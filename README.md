#Dining Philosophers Problem - HÜ TINF

##Our idea
To execute a process, there are 2 Rams needed. The problem is every process just has one Ram and a deadlock emerges.

##Our solution
There are 5 processes, which we tried to positionate like the philosophers. Every process consists of 2 Rams and a sign,which shows if the process is working or waiting.(X for waiting or not ready, ✔ for working)

Our idea was to prepare the next process to be waiting if the process before it is working.
